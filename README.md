  <h1>Perfume Brand Poster Design Project</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        During my internship as a <strong>UI/UX Developer</strong> at GeeksforGeeks (GFG) in my second year at KIIT Bhubaneswar, I created a visually appealing and brand-oriented poster for a perfume brand's website. The project involved combining <strong>UI/UX design principles</strong> with creative tools like <strong>Figma</strong>, <strong>Adobe XD</strong>, and <strong>Photoshop</strong> to deliver a polished design tailored to the brand's aesthetic and marketing needs.
